# The code is a modified version of the code in https://energia.nu/guide/tutorials/digital/tutorial_tone/
# I am playing this code using the Texas Instruments MSP432 using the Energia IDE in C++
# The pitch frequencies are defined in the pitches.h file
# This song could be played by using any buzzer that has frequencies from 0-5000Hz, however I only use 16 frequencies in this song
# You could also play this song in an arduino IDE or any compiler that runs C++ with slight modifications
# 
# Thanks and Happy Coding :)
